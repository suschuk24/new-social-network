## Usage:

This database gives API endpoints for databse interaction with a soecial networking site. 

## User Story: 

* AS A social media startup
* I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
* SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

## Acceptance Criteria: 

* GIVEN a social network API
* WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
* THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
* WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for users and thoughts
* THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
* WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
* THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
* WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
* THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
